safe
----

A simple and intuitive way to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data.


USAGE

Use NewSafe to create a new entity. You can provide a 32 bytes key or get a random one created.
If you use a random key, you won't be able to decrypt your data if you lose access to the Safe
entity or the program is restarted, so it's very recommended you provide your own key.

Check out 'safe_test.go' for some examples.


INSTALLING

go get github.com/BiRabittoh/safe
